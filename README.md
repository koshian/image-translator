# image-translator
This program started with my best friend who is a manga artist.
She wants to translate her manga from Japanese to English. 

If you put this code into your Google spreadsheet.
It will do the following. 

Preparation:
1. You need a google drive folder with manga images in JPEG format.
2. You need to get the google drive folder URL.

ie. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/xxxxxxxxx(This URL)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Manual Operation
1. Click "Custom" > "JPEG to Excel" 
2. Windows will popup asking for input google drive url. 
3. Click "OK". 

Automatic Operation
4. The program grab all the JPEGs in the specific folder. 
5. Convert all those JPEGs into Google doc, and it will extract the texts with the OCR function.
6. Grab all the texts extracted from Google doc then paste it into Google spreadsheet. 
7. All the extracted texts are translated on the next column. 
8. Done
